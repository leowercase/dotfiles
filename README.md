# Some dotfiles
This is my Nix flake for my personal machine configurations.
It uses NixOS, with Home Manager as a module.

## My Neovim configuration
I use NixVim to configure my Neovim. It's a bit rough around the edges and still very much a WIP,
but you can try it out by running:
```
nix run github:leowercase/dotfiles#nvim
```

## References
These configurations have helped me in one way or another on my Nix journey.
